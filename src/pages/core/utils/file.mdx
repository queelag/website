File utils are a set of utility functions that are designed to make working with **File** objects in ECMAScript easier and more efficient. **File** objects are used to represent files in web applications, such as images, audio files, and other types of media.

## Serialize

The **serializeFile** function is used to create a new **File** object from an **AracnaFile** object. The function takes two parameters: an **AracnaFile** object and an optional **EndingType** parameter that can be used to control the line endings of the serialized file.

<StackBlitz
  client:load
  dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }}
  files={SB_SERIALIZE_FILE}
  template='javascript'
  title='serializeFile'
  console={100}
/>

## Deserialize

The **deserializeFile** function is used to create an **AracnaFile** object from a **File** object. The **AracnaFile** class is defined elsewhere in the codebase and provides additional functionality for working with files, such as resolving the contents of the file as an array buffer or text.

<StackBlitz
  client:load
  dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }}
  files={SB_DESERIALIZE_FILE}
  template='javascript'
  title='deserializeFile'
  console={100}
/>
