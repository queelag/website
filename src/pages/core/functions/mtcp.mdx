The **mtcp** function stands for "make try catch promise", and it is a utility function that takes a function that returns a promise as its argument and returns a new function that wraps the original function in a try-catch block.

The **mtcp** function is a simple but powerful tool for making functions that return promises more robust and error-tolerant. By wrapping a function that returns a promise in a try-catch block, the **mtcp** function allows errors to be caught and handled gracefully, making it easier to write and maintain reliable code.
