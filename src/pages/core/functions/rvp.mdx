The **rvp** function is a ECMAScript utility function that takes a function as an optional argument, calls it, and returns a **Promise** that resolves to void. The name **rvp** is short for "return void promise", which reflects the function's purpose.

The **rvp** function is a simple but useful utility function that can be used to call a function and return a Promise that resolves to void. By using **rvp** instead of manually calling the function and returning a Promise that resolves to void, you can make your code more concise and easier to read.
