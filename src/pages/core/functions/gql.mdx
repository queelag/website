The **gql** function is a hack that is used to trigger code formatting on GraphQL queries. When a GraphQL query is written as a template string literal, it can be difficult to format the query properly, since the text of the query is spread across multiple lines and may contain whitespace and other formatting characters.

By passing the query through the **gql** function, the query is reduced to a single string that can be easily formatted using standard code formatting tools. This makes it easier to write and maintain GraphQL queries in a codebase.

## Usage

<StackBlitz
  client:load
  dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }}
  files={SB_GQL}
  template='javascript'
  title='gql'
  console={100}
/>
