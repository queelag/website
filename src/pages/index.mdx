# Make your ECMAScript development experience a breeze

Tired of rewriting the same boring code all over again? Aracna abstracts all the essentials for you without bloating your codebase.

## Seamless modular ecosystem

Aracna is split into multiple libraries with a clear context, these libraries are fully modular and no unused code will ever spill into your
production bundle.

<LibrariesCardsBlock client:load />

## Just works everywhere

You can use Aracna libraries in any environment, they are designed and bundled in a way that will make them work even in more complicated codebases.

<CheckedList client:load items={['Browser', 'Node.js', 'Hybrid', 'SSR']} />
