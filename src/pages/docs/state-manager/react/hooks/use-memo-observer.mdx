import { Alert } from '@/components/Alert.tsx'
import { StackBlitz } from '@/components/StackBlitz.tsx'

This hook performs a re-render when any of the observed properties used inside the render function change.

<Alert client:load severity='info'>
  The difference between this hook and
  [useObserver](/docs/state-manager/react/hooks/use-observer) is that
  [useMemoObserver](/docs/state-manager/react/hooks/use-memo-observer) will only
  react to observable changes, no other property will be able to cause a
  re-render.
</Alert>

### Usage

<StackBlitz client:load id='react-ts-yedutz' />

### Memo Comparison

<StackBlitz client:load id='react-ts-gvopzd' />
