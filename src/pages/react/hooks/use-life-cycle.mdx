The useLifeCycle hook is a custom React hook that returns a mutable ref object that holds the current lifecycle state of the component.

The **CONSTRUCTED** value represents the constructed state of the component, which is the state of the component before it is mounted to the DOM.

The **MOUNTED** value represents the mounted state of the component, which is the state of the component after it is mounted to the DOM.

The **UNMOUNTED** value represents the unmounted state of the component, which is the state of the component after it is unmounted from the DOM.
