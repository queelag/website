The **useMemoObserver** hook is a custom hook that is designed to be used with React functional components. It is a wrapper around the **useObserver** hook from the same module, which is responsible for observing changes to observable data and re-rendering the component when necessary.

The **useMemoObserver** hook takes a single argument, which is a function that returns a React node. This function is executed whenever the observer detects a change to the observable data, and the resulting React node is returned to the component.

<Alert client:load severity='info'>
  The main difference between **useObserver** and **useMemoObserver** is that
  the latter uses memoization to optimize performance.
</Alert>
