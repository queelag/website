The **forwardRef** function is a utility function provided by React that allows a component to receive a ref passed down from its parent component. It takes in a render function as its argument, which is a function that returns a React element. The **forwardRef** function returns a new component that wraps the original component and passes the ref down to it. The new component can then be used in place of the original component, and it will receive the ref as a prop.
