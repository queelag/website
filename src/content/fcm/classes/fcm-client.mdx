The FcmClient class establishes a TLS socket connection with Google MTalk and handles the communication.

- The client needs a valid ACG ID and ACG security token to login, they can be obtained with the `registerToFCM` function.
- The client needs a valid ECE auth secret and ECE private key to decrypt the messages, they can be obtained with the `createFcmECDH` and `generateFcmAuthSecret` functions.
- The client will store the received persistent IDs in the storage. By default the storage is an in-memory storage, it is reccomended to use a persistent storage.
- The client will perform a heartbeat every 5 seconds to avoid losing the socket connection.

## Events

- The client will emit a `close` event when a close message is received.
- The client will emit a `heartbeat` event when a heartbeat is received.
- The client will emit a `iq` event when an IQ stanza is received.
- The client will emit a `login` event when a login response is received.
- The client will emit a `message` event when a message is received.
- The client will emit a `message-data` event when a message is decrypted.

## Connect

The `connect` function connects the socket to Google MTalk.

- The persistent IDs received in the previous session will be retrieved from the storage to communicate them to the server during the login.
- The ACG ID and ACG security token will be verified before connecting.

<Alert client:load severity='warning'>
  The ACG ID and ACG security token are required to connect.

## Disconnect

The `disconnect` function disconnects the socket.

<CodeBlock

## Listen to messages

The client emits a `message` event when a message is received and a `message-data` event when a message is decrypted. The client is an event emitter, so you can use the `on` function to listen to the events.

<Alert client:load severity='warning'>
  The ECE auth secret and ECE private key are required to decrypt the messages.
