The **ChipElement** is a custom web component often used in modern web development. It's typically a compact element that represents an input, attribute, or action. Chips can contain brief pieces of information like a photo, text, or a small icon. They are commonly used for contacts, text, rules, or filter additions in a compact presentation. They can also be used to represent complex pieces of information in a small block, such as a short summary of a user's contact information.
