The **CarouselElement** is a custom web component that represents a carousel. A carousel, also known as a slider or slideshow, is a web component that displays a series of content (like images, text, or cards) in a sequential or rotating manner. It's a common feature on many websites, particularly on homepages, where it's used to showcase multiple items within a confined space.

Users can navigate through the items in the carousel by using controls such as next and previous buttons, or by using indicators like dots or tabs. Some carousels also have the ability to rotate automatically, pausing the rotation when the user interacts with the carousel.

<CarouselComponentBlock client:load type='buttons' />

## Buttons

A carousel with next and previous slide controls is a web component that displays a series of content (like images, text, or cards) in a sequential or rotating manner. The next and previous slide controls are typically represented as buttons or arrows on either side of the carousel.

    '@aracna/core': 'latest',
    '@aracna/web': 'latest',
    '@aracna/web-components': 'latest',
    dompurify: 'latest',
    lit: 'latest',
    'lit-html': 'latest'
  }}
  files={SB_CAROUSEL_BUTTONS}
  template='javascript'
  title='Carousel'
/>

## Tabs

A carousel with tabs is a type of web component that displays a series of content (like images, text, or cards) in a sequential or rotating manner, similar to a standard carousel. However, in addition to the usual navigation controls (like next and previous buttons), a carousel with tabs also provides a set of tabs or indicators, usually positioned at the bottom or top of the carousel.

Each tab corresponds to a slide in the carousel. Users can navigate through the items in the carousel by clicking on these tabs. When a tab is clicked, the carousel jumps directly to the corresponding slide. This provides a way for users to quickly navigate to a specific slide without having to cycle through all the other slides.
