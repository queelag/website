title: EventEmitter

The `EventEmitter` class is used to emit events and register listeners. The API is based on the Node.js EventEmitter API.

## Listen to an event

The `addListener` method is used to add a listener to the EventEmitter instance. This listener will be invoked when the event it is listening to is emitted.
