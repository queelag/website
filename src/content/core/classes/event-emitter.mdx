title: EventEmitter
---

The `EventEmitter` class is used to emit events and register listeners. The API is based on the Node.js EventEmitter API.

## Listen to an event

The `on` method adds a listener, which will be called when the event is emitted. Optionally the listener can be removed after the first call with the `once` option. Optionally the listener can be prepended to the listeners array with the `prepend` option.

## Emit an event

The `emit` method emits an event.

## Remove listeners

The `off` method removes the listeners that match the name, callback and options. If no arguments are passed, all listeners will be removed.
