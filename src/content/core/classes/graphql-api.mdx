The `GraphQlAPI` class extends the `RestAPI` class and manages the requests to a GraphQL API.

- The base URL of the API is automatically concatenated to the path of the requests.
- The config of the API is automatically merged with the config of the requests.
- The status of the requests is automatically tracked and can be accessed through the status property.
- The requests are sent with the `Fetch` class, so all features of the `Fetch` class are available.

## Properties

- **baseURL (string)**: The base URL of the GraphQL API. This is the URL that will be prepended to all request paths.
- **config (T extends GraphQlApiConfig)**: The default configuration for the GraphQL API. This configuration will be merged with the configuration of individual requests.
- **status (Status)**: The status of the requests. This property tracks the status of each request (e.g., pending, success, error) and can be accessed to check the status of a request.

## Send a query

The `query` method is used to send a query to the GraphQL API.

<CodeBlock client:load dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_GRAPHQL_API_QUERY} template='javascript' title='GraphQLAPI' console={100} />

## Send a mutation

The `mutation` method is used to send a mutation to the GraphQL API.

<CodeBlock client:load dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_GRAPHQL_API_MUTATION} template='javascript' title='GraphQLAPI' console={100} />
