The **GraphQLAPI** class extends the [**API**](/core/modules/api) class and provides a convenient way to make GraphQL API requests using the **fetch** API. The **API** class provides a set of methods for making HTTP requests, while the **GraphQLAPI** class provides additional functionality for making GraphQL API requests.

## Query

The **query** method defined in the **GraphQLAPI** class is used to make a GraphQL query to the server using the **POST** HTTP method. In GraphQL, a query is a string that defines the data that the client wants to retrieve from the server.

The **query** method provides a convenient way to make a GraphQL query to the server using the **POST** HTTP method. The method takes a **query** string, an optional **variables** object, and an optional **config** object as arguments, and returns a **Promise** that resolves to a **GraphQLAPIResponse** object or a **FetchError** object. The **query** argument is a string that contains the GraphQL query to be sent to the server, and can be used to retrieve specific data from the server based on the client's needs.

## Mutation

The **mutation** method defined in the **GraphQLAPI** class is used to make a GraphQL mutation to the server using the **POST** HTTP method.

The **mutation** method provides a convenient way to make a GraphQL mutation to the server using the **POST** HTTP method. The method takes a **mutation** string, an optional **variables** object, and an optional **config** object as arguments, and returns a **Promise** that resolves to a **GraphQLAPIResponse** object or a **FetchError** object. The **mutation** argument is a string that contains the GraphQL mutation to be sent to the server, and can be used to modify data on the server based on the client's needs.
