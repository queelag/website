The `RestAPI` class manages the requests to a REST API.

- The base URL of the API is automatically concatenated to the path of the requests.
- The config of the API is automatically merged with the config of the requests.
- The status of the requests is automatically tracked and can be accessed through the status property.
- The requests are sent with the `Fetch` class, so all features of the `Fetch` class are available.

## Properties

- **baseURL (string)**: The base URL of the REST API. This is the URL that will be prepended to all request paths.
- **config (T extends RestApiConfig)**: The default configuration for the REST API. This configuration will be merged with the configuration of individual requests.
- **status (Status)**: The status of the requests. This property tracks the status of each request (e.g., pending, success, error) and can be accessed to check the status of a request.

## Send a request

The `connect`, `delete`, `get`, `head`, `options`, `patch`, `post`, `put` and `trace` methods can be used to send a request to the REST API.

<CodeBlock client:load dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_REST_API_GET} template='javascript' title='API' console={100} />

## Track the status of a request

The `status` property in the `RestAPI` class is an instance of the `Status` class. It is used to track the status of the requests sent by the `RestAPI` class.

<CodeBlock client:load dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_REST_API_STATUS} template='javascript' title='API' console={100} />

## Transform the request body

The `transformBody` method is used to transform the body of a request before it is sent.

This method accepts four parameters:

- `method`: A string representing the HTTP method of the request.
- `path`: A string representing the path of the request.
- `body`: The body of the request. It can be any type and it can be `undefined`.
- `config`: The configuration of the request. It is an instance of the `RestApiConfig` class.

The `transformBody` method is asynchronous and returns a promise that resolves with the transformed body.

<CodeBlock client:load dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_REST_API_TRANSFORM_BODY} template='javascript' title='API' console={100} />

## Transform the request query params

The `transformQueryParameters` method is used to transform the query parameters of a request before it is sent.

This method accepts four parameters:

- `method`: A string representing the HTTP method of the request.
- `path`: A string representing the path of the request.
- `body`: The body of the request. It can be any type and it can be `undefined`.
- `config`: The configuration of the request. It is an instance of the `RestApiConfig` class.

The `transformQueryParameters` method is asynchronous and returns a promise that resolves with the transformed query parameters as a string.

<CodeBlock
  client:load
  dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }}
  files={SB_REST_API_TRANSFORM_QUERY_PARAMETERS}
  template='javascript'
  title='API'
  console={100}
/>

## Use a custom error status handler

The `handleError` method is used to handle any errors that occur during the execution of a request.

This method accepts five parameters:

- `method`: A string representing the HTTP method of the request.
- `path`: A string representing the path of the request.
- `body`: The body of the request. It can be any type and it can be `undefined`.
- `config`: The configuration of the request. It is an instance of the `RestApiConfig` class.
- `error`: The error that occurred during the execution of the request. It is an instance of the `FetchError` class.

The `handleError` method returns a boolean indicating whether the error was handled. If the method returns `true`, the error was handled and the request can continue. If the method returns `false`, the error was not handled and the request should be aborted.

<CodeBlock client:load dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_REST_API_HANDLE_ERROR} template='javascript' title='API' console={100} />

## Use a custom pending status handler

The `handlePending` method is used to handle the pending state of a request. This method is called before the request is sent.

This method accepts four parameters:

- `method`: A string representing the HTTP method of the request.
- `path`: A string representing the path of the request.
- `body`: The body of the request. It can be any type and it can be `undefined`.
- `config`: The configuration of the request. It is an instance of the `RestApiConfig` class.

The `handlePending` method is asynchronous and returns a promise that resolves with a boolean indicating whether the pending state was handled. If the method returns `true`, the pending state was handled and the request can continue. If the method returns `false`, the pending state was not handled and the request should be aborted.

<CodeBlock client:load dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_REST_API_HANDLE_PENDING} template='javascript' title='API' console={100} />

## Use a custom success status handler

The `handleSuccess` method is used to handle the successful state of a request. This method is called after the request is successfully completed.

This method accepts five parameters:

- `method`: A string representing the HTTP method of the request.
- `path`: A string representing the path of the request.
- `body`: The body of the request. It can be any type and it can be `undefined`.
- `config`: The configuration of the request. It is an instance of the `RestApiConfig` class.
- `response`: The response of the request. It is an instance of the `FetchResponse` class.

The `handleSuccess` method is asynchronous and returns a promise that resolves with a boolean indicating whether the successful state was handled. If the method returns `true`, the successful state was handled and the request can continue. If the method returns `false`, the successful state was not handled and the request should be aborted.

<CodeBlock client:load dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_REST_API_HANDLE_SUCCESS} template='javascript' title='API' console={100} />
