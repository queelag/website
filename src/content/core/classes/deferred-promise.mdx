The `DeferredPromise` class is built on top of the native Promise class. It provides a way to resolve or reject a promise from the outside.

## Properties

- **instance (Promise\<T\>):** The native promise instance.
- **reason (any):** The reason for the rejection of the promise.
- **state (PromiseState):** The state of the promise, can be pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
- **value (T):** The value of the resolved promise.

## Getters

- **isFulfilled:** This getter checks if the promise is fulfilled. It returns true if the state of the promise is fulfilled, otherwise it returns false.
- **isPending:** This getter checks if the promise is pending. It returns true if the state of the promise is pending, otherwise it returns false.
- **isRejected:** This getter checks if the promise is rejected. It returns true if the state of the promise is rejected, otherwise it returns false.
- **isResolved:** This getter checks if the promise is resolved. It returns true if the promise is fulfilled, otherwise it returns false.

## Resolve the Promise

The `resolve` method is used to signal that the `DeferredPromise` has completed successfully and to provide the resulting value.

<CodeBlock
  client:load
  dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }}
  files={SB_DEFERRED_PROMISE_RESOLVE}
  template='javascript'
  title='DeferredPromise'
  console={100}
/>

## Reject the Promise

The `reject` method is used to signal that the `DeferredPromise` has been rejected and to provide the reason for the rejection.

<CodeBlock
  client:load
  dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }}
  files={SB_DEFERRED_PROMISE_REJECT}
  template='javascript'
  title='DeferredPromise'
  console={100}
