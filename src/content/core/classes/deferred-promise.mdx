The **DeferredPromise** class is a module that handles deferred promises. It is used to create a promise that can be resolved or rejected at a later time. The class has a **Promise** instance and a **PromiseState** property that represents the state of the promise. The **PromiseState** is an enumeration that has three possible values: **PENDING**, **FULFILLED**, and **REJECTED**.

The **DeferredPromise** class also has a **instance** property that represents the **Promise** instance. This property can be used to chain other promise methods to the **DeferredPromise** instance.
