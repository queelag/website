The `Fetch` class is an isomorphic utility built on top of the native Fetch API, meaning it can be used in both Node.js and browsers.

- The body and headers of the request are automatically generated based on the body.
- The body of the response is dynamically parsed based on the Content-Type header, unless the parse option is set to false.
- Enabling logs will give you a detailed overview of the requests and responses.

## Send a request

The `send`, `connect`, `delete`, `get`, `head`, `options`, `patch`, `post`, `put` and `trace` methods can be used to send a request.
