The **Appearance** class provides functionality for managing the appearance of an application, including the theme and color scheme.

The **Appearance** class constructor takes two optional parameters: a callback function to be called when the theme changes, and an initial theme value. The class also has a **storage** property that can be used to store the appearance settings.
