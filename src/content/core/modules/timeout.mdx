The **Timeout** class abstracts and simplifies the usage of the **setTimeout** and **clearTimeout** APIs, providing a simple and flexible interface for managing timeouts in ECMAScript.

## Function as Key

The **set** method can be called with two arguments: **fn** and **ms**. When called with these arguments, the **set** method sets a timeout that will execute the **fn** function after **ms** milliseconds, and uses the **fn** function as the key for the timeout.

The **unset** method is used to clear a timeout that was previously set using the **set** method. The **unset** method takes a **TimeoutMapKey** as input, which is the key that was used to set the timeout.

## Identifier as Key

The **set** method can be called with three arguments: **name**, **fn**, and **ms**. When called with these arguments, the **set** method sets a timeout that will execute the **fn** function after ms milliseconds, and uses the **name** string as the key for the timeout.

The **unset** method is used to clear a timeout that was previously set using the **set** method. The **unset** method takes a **TimeoutMapKey** as input, which is the key that was used to set the timeout.

<CodeBlock client:load dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_TIMEOUT_NAME_AS_KEY} template='javascript' title='Timeout' console={100} />

## Clear

The **clear** method is used to clear all timeouts that were previously set using the **set** method.

<CodeBlock client:load dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_TIMEOUT_CLEAR} template='javascript' title='Timeout' console={100} />
