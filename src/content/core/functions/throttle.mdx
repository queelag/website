The purpose of this function is to limit the rate at which a function can be called. This is useful in situations where a function may be called too frequently, such as in response to a user input event.

The **throttle** function takes three arguments: a key, a function, and a time interval in milliseconds. The key is an optional string that is used to identify the function being throttled. If a key is not provided, the function itself is used as the key.

This implementation of the throttle function is a useful tool for limiting the rate at which a function can be called.

## Function as Key

When the **throttle** function is called with only two arguments, **fn** and **ms**, it uses the provided function as the key to identify the function being throttled.

## Identifier as Key

When the **throttle** function is called with three arguments, **name**, **fn**, and **ms**, it uses the provided **name** as the key to identify the function being throttled. This means that the throttling is applied consistently across all calls to the function with the same name.

When using the **throttle** function with a custom **name** argument, you can safely define the function inline. This is because the **name** argument is used as the key to identify the function being throttled, so as long as the same **name** argument is used consistently, the throttling will be applied correctly.
