The `throttle` function is used to prevent a function from being called too many times in a short period. The function will only be called if the time since the last call is greater than or equal to the specified amount of time.

## Use normally

When calling `throttle` with only the function and the time, the function will be used as the key.

<Alert client:load severity='warning'>
  The function passed to the `throttle` function must be constant, otherwise the debounce will not work.
</Alert>

<CodeBlock
  client:load
  className='mt-6'
  dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }}
  files={SB_THROTTLE_FN_AS_KEY}
  template='javascript'
  title='throttle'
  console={100}
/>

## Use a custom key

The `throttle` function can also be called with a custom key. This is useful when you want to debounce a function that is not constant.

<CodeBlock client:load dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_THROTTLE_NAME_AS_KEY} template='javascript' title='throttle' console={100} />
