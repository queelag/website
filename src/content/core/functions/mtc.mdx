The **mtc** function stands for "make try catch", and it is a utility function that takes a function as its argument and returns a new function that wraps the original function in a try-catch block.

The **mtc** function is a simple but powerful tool for making functions more robust and error-tolerant. By wrapping a function in a try-catch block, the **mtc** function allows errors to be caught and handled gracefully, making it easier to write and maintain reliable code.
