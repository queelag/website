The purpose of this function is to ensure that a given function is only executed if it hasn't been called again for a certain amount of time. This is useful in situations where a function might be called multiple times in quick succession, but we only want to execute it once after a certain amount of time has passed.

This **debounce** function is a useful tool for ensuring that a function is only executed once after a certain amount of time has passed since the last time it was called. It is a simple and effective way to prevent unnecessary function calls and improve the performance of your code.

## Function as Key

When the **debounce** function is called with only **fn** and **ms** arguments, the **fn** function is used as a key to identify the debounce timeout.

<CodeBlock client:load dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_DEBOUNCE_FN_AS_KEY} template='javascript' title='debounce' console={100} />

## Identifier as Key

When the debounce function is called with a name, fn, and ms arguments, the name argument is used as a key to identify the debounce timeout.

When using the **name** argument as a key to identify the debounce timeout, you can safely define the **fn** function as an inline function. This is because the **name** argument is used as the key to identify the debounce timeout, so the **fn** function itself is not used as a key.
