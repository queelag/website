The `debounce` function is used to prevent a function from being called too many times in a short period. The function will only be called after it stops being called for the specified amount of time.

## Use normally

When calling `debounce` with only the function and the time, the function will be used as the key.

<Alert client:load severity='warning'>
  The function passed to the `debounce` function must be constant, otherwise the debounce will not work.
</Alert>

<CodeBlock client:load className='mt-6' dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_DEBOUNCE} template='javascript' title='debounce' console={100} />

## Use with a custom key

The `debounce` function can also be called with a custom key. This is useful when you want to debounce a function that is not constant.

<CodeBlock client:load dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_DEBOUNCE_CUSTOM_KEY} template='javascript' title='debounce' console={100} />
