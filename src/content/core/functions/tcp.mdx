The **tcp** function is a ECMAScript utility function that takes a function that returns a **Promise** as an argument, calls it, and returns the result of the function or the error that was thrown. The name **tcp** is short for "try catch promise", which reflects the function's purpose.

The **tcp** function is a simple but useful utility function that can be used to call a function that returns a **Promise** inside a try-catch block and handle errors in a custom way. By using **tcp** instead of manually writing try-catch blocks, you can make your code more concise and easier to read.
