Error utils are a set of utility functions that are designed to make working with errors in ECMAScript easier and more efficient. Errors are a common occurrence in web applications, and can be caused by a variety of factors such as invalid user input, network issues, or programming errors.

## Check Instance

The **isError** function is used to check whether a given value is an **Error** object. The function takes any value as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input value is an Error object.

The **isNotError** function is used to check whether a given value is not an **Error** object. The function takes any value as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input value is not an Error object.
