Promise utils are a set of utility functions that are designed to make working with Promises in ECMAScript easier and more efficient.

## Chain Synchronously

The **chainPromises** function is a utility function that allows you to execute a sequence of asynchronous functions in a controlled manner. The function takes any number of functions that return Promises as arguments using the rest parameter syntax, and executes them in sequence using a **for** loop and the **await** keyword.

<CodeBlock client:load dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }} files={SB_CHAIN_PROMISES} template='javascript' title='chainPromises' console={100} />

## Chain Truthy Synchronously

The **chainTruthyPromises** function is a utility function that allows you to execute a sequence of asynchronous functions in a controlled manner and check whether each Promise resolves to a truthy value. The function takes any number of functions that return Promises as arguments using the rest parameter syntax, and executes them in sequence using a for loop and the await keyword.

<CodeBlock
  client:load
  dependencies={{ '@aracna/core': 'latest' }}
  files={SB_CHAIN_TRUTHY_PROMISES}
  template='javascript'
  title='chainTruthyPromises'
  console={100}
/>
