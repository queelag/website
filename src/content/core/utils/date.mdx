Date utils are a set of utility functions that are designed to make working with dates and times in ECMAScript easier and more efficient. Dates and times are a fundamental part of many web applications, and are used for a variety of purposes such as scheduling, logging, and data analysis.

## Get Unix Time

The **getDateUnixTime** function is used to convert a date string, number, or **Date** object into a Unix timestamp. The function takes a date value and an optional unit of time (**'ms'** or **'s'**) as input, and returns the Unix timestamp in milliseconds or seconds, depending on the specified unit of time.
